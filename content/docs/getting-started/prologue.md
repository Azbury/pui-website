As part of [Ritter Insurance Marketing](https://ritterim.com)'s software development team, RIMdev, our frontend folks started Platform UI as a CSS framework for faster, more efficient development. Our suite of agent and staff tools have benefitted greatly, along with our team.

Platform UI has evolved in scope to include a base icon font family, Platform Icons, UI kits based in Adode XD, and, our philosophies and practices SPAs, static sites, and application development. 

We hope you find it as useful and easy to use as we do.
