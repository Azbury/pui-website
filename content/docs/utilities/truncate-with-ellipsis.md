A utility that does what it's name says. It truncates text within an element with ellipsis.

The heading in the first block has the class `truncate-with-ellipsis` added to it.

<div class="block-container tablet-up-4 blocks px-2">
    <div class="block">
        <h3 class="truncate-with-ellipsis">This is a heading for a block</h3>
        <p>This a a paragraph inside a block. This paragraph also happens to be unerneath the heading.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
{{< highlight html >}}
<h3 class="truncate-with-ellipsis">This is a heading for a block</h3>
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>
