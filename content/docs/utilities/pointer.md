If you want to ensure that the mouse is a pointer on hover add the class `pointer`.

<div class="card">
    <h3>Hover over the text below</h3>
    <p class="pointer">This is a standard p and doesn't have a pointer, unless you hover.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3 mb-4">
{{< highlight html >}}
<div class="card">
    <h3>Hover over the text below</h3>
    <p class="pointer">This is a standard p and doesn't have a pointer, unless you hover.</p>
</div>
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>
