This utility should be placed on a heading when you are using a fixed header (header-fixed). What this will do is ensure that your heading will not be hidden by the header when the page scrolls. Add the class `page-anchor-target` to a heading or section you want to scroll to on your page. We have added this utility to our headings within these doc pages, including the heading below. Click on it to see what I mean.
