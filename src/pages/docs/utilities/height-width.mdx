We handle height and width both in percentages and view-height/width. Both are broken into quarters.

## [Percentage](#percentage)

<Classes result="true">
<Classesrow classname="h-{ 25, 50, 75, 100 }" result="Height is set to the corresponding percentage." />
<Classesrow classname="h-auto" result="Height is set to auto." />
<Classesrow classname="w-{ 25, 50, 75, 100 }" result="Width is set to the corresponding percentage." />
<Classesrow classname="w-auto" result="Width is set to auto." />
</Classes>

## [Viewport](#viewport)

<Classes result="true">
<Classesrow classname="vh-{ 25, 50, 75, 100 }" result="Height is set to the corresponding percentage based on the viewport." />
<Classesrow classname="vw-{ 25, 50, 75, 100 }" result="Width is set to the corresponding percentage based on the viewport." />
</Classes>
